# 🐍 Python Student Management System

This repository contains our group Python assignment for building a simple
Student Management System. The system supports basic operations such as
adding, updating, and deleting student records.

The project demonstrates foundational Python programming concepts including:
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Input handling
- Basic CRUD logic
- Collaboration in group coding

## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

In this group project, my contributions include:

### ✔ Writing the initial implementations for:
- **Q2.1 – Add Student**
- **Q2.2 – Update Student**
- **Q2.3 – Delete Student**

These early versions formed the base logic that the final integrated script was built upon.

# Python Student Management System (Basic Version)

This project is a simple Python program created for my Introduction to Programming coursework.
It follows the assignment steps (Task 2.1 to 2.3) where each function was built gradually:

### ✅ 2.1 Add Student  
Basic input handling and storing student information in a list.

### ✅ 2.2 View Students  
Displaying all student records from the list.

### ✅ 2.3 Delete Student  
Deleting a student using the index shown in the list.

After completing the tasks individually, they were combined into a simple menu-based CRUD system.

## 📌 Features
- Add new student  
- View student list  
- Delete student  
- Simple loop-based menu  
- Uses list of dictionaries (beginner-friendly approach)

## 📁 File Included
- `student_management_basic.py` — The complete basic CRUD program

This version represents my **initial implementation** before any improvements were made.


### ✔ Participating in debugging and discussion
I helped test functions, identify errors, and verify inputs/outputs during development.

### ✔ Collaborating with teammates
The **final consolidated version** of the system was developed and enhanced by another teammate, who added:
- Formatting
- Improved menu structure
- Better error handling
- Additional features

My initial work is preserved separately to clearly show my personal contribution.
